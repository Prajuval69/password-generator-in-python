# password-generator-in-python
This Python script generates a random password based on user-defined criteria for the number of letters, symbols, and numbers required in the password.

How it Works
1.User Input: The program prompts the user to input the number of letters, symbols, and numbers desired in the password.
2.Password Generation: Using the random and string modules, the script creates separate lists for letters (uppercase and lowercase), symbols, and numbers.
3.Random Selection: For each category (letters, symbols, numbers), the script randomly selects the specified number of characters.
4.Password Composition: The selected characters are concatenated to form the initial password string.
5.Shuffling: The password characters are shuffled using random.shuffle to enhance randomness.
6.Output: The generated password, fulfilling the requested criteria, is displayed to the user.
